- 👋 Hi, I’m @jv-garcia, a developer based in Berlin, Germany.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and its surrounding ecosystem. I think at this point I've drunk the Kool-Aid.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate more on Rust open-source projects to learn even more.
- 📫 How to reach me: take my handle, remove the hyphen, and add the domain of the email service provided by the biggest search engine out there and you reach me.
